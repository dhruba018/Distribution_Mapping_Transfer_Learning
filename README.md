### Distribution Mapping based Transfer Learning

This is the repo for distribution matching based transfer learning.  
* source_set, target_set => estimate distribution mapping
* target_set => Use DM to move to source space
* source_set => Train predictive model => Mapped target_set => predict response in the source space
* Predicted target response => Use DM to map back to target space
